# Dyslexia Friendly

This extension is designed to make Visual Studio Code more accessible to users with dyslexia. It includes the OpenDyslexia font by [Abbie Gonzalez](https://abbiecod.es|support@abbiecod.es) - but if for some reason it doesn't load on your system, you can download it from the [OpenDyslexia website](https://opendyslexic.org/).

Once you've downloaded and installed the font, enable the extension and you're good to go.


## Requirements

 OpenDyslexia font from the [OpenDyslexia website](https://opendyslexic.org/).
